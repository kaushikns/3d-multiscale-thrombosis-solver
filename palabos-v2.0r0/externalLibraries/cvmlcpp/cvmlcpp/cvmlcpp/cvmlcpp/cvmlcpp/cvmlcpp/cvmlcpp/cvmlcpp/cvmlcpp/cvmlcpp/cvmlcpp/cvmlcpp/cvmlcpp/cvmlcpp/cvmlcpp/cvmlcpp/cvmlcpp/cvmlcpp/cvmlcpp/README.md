*** CVMLCPP ***

A C++ library of useful classes and functions, put together so that you 
do not need to program the same stuff yourself.

See http://tech.unige.ch/cvmlcpp/ for additional information such as 
software dependencies, and instructions for building, installing and
uninstalling.

After installation, documentation can be found here:
