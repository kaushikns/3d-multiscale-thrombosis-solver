/** \file
 * Simulation of a 3D Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which describes a symmetry breakdown,
 * as a heavy fluid, initially located on top of a light one, starts penetrating the
 * latter. This is an illutration of the Shan/Chen multi-component model. Note that the
 * single-component multi-phase model is also implemented in Palabos, and a corresponding
 * sample program is provided. Also, note that the multi-component model can be used to
 * couple more than two phases, using the same approach as the one shown here.
